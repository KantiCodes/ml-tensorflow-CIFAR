# ml-tensorflow-CIFAR
image classification using tensorflow

# Introduction
In this project I am going to use classic neural networks and convolutional neural network to classify the CIFAR-10 data set.  
I am going to user tensor flow to develop my model


# The [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) datas set
"The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images."
